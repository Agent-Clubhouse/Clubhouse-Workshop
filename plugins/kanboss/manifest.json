Each board starts with three states (Todo, In Progress, Done) and a Default swimlane.\n\n### Cards\nCards live at the intersection of a state (column) and swimlane (row). Click **+ Add** in any cell to create a card. Cards support labels for categorization and five priority levels.\n\n### Labels\nCreate colored labels to categorize cards (bug, feature, chore, etc.). Labels are defined per-board in board settings.\n\n### WIP Limits\nSet a maximum number of cards per column. When a column is at or over its limit, it's highlighted to help prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Automation\nMark a state as **Automatic** and provide execution and evaluation prompts. When a card enters that state in a swimlane with an assigned durable agent, a quick agent is spawned to complete the task. A separate evaluation agent then checks the outcome using the evaluation prompt.\n\n### Zoom\nUse the zoom controls in the toolbar to scale the board view between 50% and 200%."

Assign a durable agent as **manager** for a swimlane\n3. Mark a state as **Automatic** and write an execution prompt\n4. Optionally write a separate **evaluation prompt** for that state\n5. Set **Max Retries** (default: 3)\n\n### Flow\n1. Card enters an automatic state in a managed swimlane\n2. A quick agent executes the execution prompt\n3. An evaluation agent checks the outcome using the evaluation prompt\n4. On success: card advances to the next state\n5. On failure: card retries (up to max retries)\n6. If retries exhausted: card is marked **stuck**\n\n### Per-State Evaluation\nEach automatic state can have its own evaluation prompt, separate from the execution prompt. This lets you tailor the success criteria for each stage of your pipeline."
