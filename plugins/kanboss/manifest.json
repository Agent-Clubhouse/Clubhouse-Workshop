Each board starts with three states (Todo, In Progress, Done) and a Default swimlane.\n\n**Cards** — Cards live at the intersection of a state (column) and swimlane (row). Click **+ Add** in any cell. Cards support colored labels and five priority levels.\n\n**WIP Limits** — Set a maximum card count per column. Over-limit columns are highlighted to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n**Automation** — Mark a state as **Automatic** with execution and evaluation prompts. Assign a durable agent to a swimlane. When a card enters an automatic state, a quick agent executes the task and a separate agent evaluates the result. On success, the card advances; on failure, it retries (up to max retries) or is marked stuck.\n\n**Per-State Evaluation** — Each automatic state can have its own evaluation prompt, letting you tailor success criteria per pipeline stage.\n\n**Zoom** — Scale the board view between 50% and 200%."
